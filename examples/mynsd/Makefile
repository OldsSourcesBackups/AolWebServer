# Example simple Makefile to build a statically linked nsd.  In addition
# to building all the AOLserver libraries and code, Tcl must first be
# built statically as well.  This makefile is only known to work on Linux.
# 
# Once built, you should verify all symbols are in "mynsd" with nm and
# that no AOLserver or Tcl dynamic libraries will be used with "ldd".
# And be sure to comment out the cooresponding ns/server/{server}/modules
# section as the server will still attempt to load those modules which
# will generally confuse things.

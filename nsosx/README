nsosx/README
------------

The routines in nsosx.c are Unix API's missing from Apple OS/X
required by Tcl and/or AOLserver.  To build on OS/X (AOLSERVER is
your AOLserver source directory):

1.	Build nsosx.o:

	cd $(AOLSERVER)/nsosx
	make

2.      Download Tcl as expected, e.g., into ../tcl8.4 relative to
	$(AOLSERVER).

3.	Configure Tcl using AOLserver's Makefile to get the right flags:

	cd $(AOLSERVER)
	make ../tcl8.4/unix/Makefile

4.      Edit ../tcl8.4/unix/Makefile to add the full location of nsosx.o to
	the COMPAT_OBJS list, e.g.:

	change:
		COMPAT_OBJS =  strtoll.o strtoull.o

	to:
		COMPAT_OBJS =  strtoll.o strtoull.o ../../aolserver/nsosx/libnsosx.a

5.	Build everything normally:

	cd $(AOLSERVER)
	make


Yes, this is a hack but reasonably isolated.  Enjoy! -Jim

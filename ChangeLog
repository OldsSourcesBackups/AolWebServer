	* include/ns.h:
          nsd/driver.c:
          nssock/nssock.c:
          nsssl/nsssl.c: Modified Ns_DriverInit. Instead of passing all args
          as parameters to Ns_DriverInit, a comm module must now create an
          Ns_DriverInitData structure and populate it with appropriate values
          (see include/ns.h) and pass that in the call to Ns_DriverInit. The
          Ns_DriverInitData structure is versioned so that we can extend it
          later without affecting other modules.

        configuration was moved from ns/server/<server> to
        ns/server/<server>/fastpath. This change will require you to

	  o. added _ns_getpackages to enable "package require".
	  o. fixed various issues in ns_getscript proc related to
	     loading Tcl modules which define namespaced versions
	     of standard Tcl commands.
	  o. fixed ns_eval to return value/error and made compatible
	     with standard Tcl "eval" and AOLserver "ns_eval" from 3.x
	  o. made the entire file little bit more readable.

2003-01-17  Mark Page  <mpagenva@aol.com>

	* nsd/driver.c: Change to SockRead; if request has a
	content-length, null-terminate the content at the specified
	length.  This fixes a problem when some browsers add extra CRLF

        registered tags inside of html tags (ex. <td bgcolor='<tag n='v'>'> )

        * nsd/tclset.c: Fixed a bug with ns_set tcl commands.  
        ns_set idelkey|delkey would not actually delete the key.

2002-11-02  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* nsd/fastpath.c:  Fixed bug with non-server specific cache names.

2002-11-01  Jeremy Collins <jcollins@phpsource.net>

        to properly parse attribute values with spaces in them.

2002-10-29  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* sample-config.tcl:  Updated with examples for connection
	thread pools and Host header virtual servers.

	* Makefile:  Uses /bin/sh to invoke install-doc.

	* doc/install-doc:  Uses /bin/sh to invoke mkLinks.

	* nsd/form.c:
	* nsd/conn.c:
	* tcl/form.tcl:  Changed "ns_conn files" command to just
	return names of file upload widgets, moving access to other
	meta data to new fileoffset, filelength, and fileheaders
	subcommands. Also, removed the ns_conn string command
	instead of updating.

	* nsd/nsd.h:
	* nsd/driver.c:
	* nsd/nsmain.c:
	* nsd/server.c:
	* nsd/queue.c:  Implemented multiple named thread pools

	selection.  See sample-config.tcl for config example.

	* nsd/info.c: Fixed crash bug with NULL server.

	* nsd/tclcmds.c: Removed NsTclConnCmd and NsTclServerCmd
	string commands.


2002-10-14  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* include/Makefile.module:  Added .PHONY targets and man
	page install target.

	* nsd/conn.c:  Made "ns_conn copy" use Tcl_Write instead
	of Tcl_WriteChars to fix binary file upload bug.

	* nsd/form.c:  Fixed bug where Ns_ConnGetQuery (i.e.,
	ns_conn form) could not handle binary data in multpart file
	uploads.  Also, "ns_conn files" now returns file type.

	into a standard (thread enabled) tclsh or linked into a
	custom tclsh.  Calling Ns_TclInit from a custom tclsh or
	loading libnsd.so via the load command will add many
	non-server AOLserver commands (e.g., adds ns_set but not
	ns_adp_puts).

	* nsd/server.c:
	* nsd/tcljob.c:  Changed ns_job command to create and queue
	jobs to named queues instead of per-server queues.

	* nsd/tclthread.c:  Added a special Tcl address object type
	to speed access to the object id's.

	* nsd/sched.c:  Threaded events now use a thread pool
	instead of create/delete each time.

	* tcl/form.tcl:  Fixed bug accessing uploaded binary files
	with the ns_getform proc and added ns_getformfile proc to
	address the ".tmpfile" security issue.

	* nsd/queue.c:
	* nsd/tclcmds.c:
	* nsd/tclset.c:  Added object commands.

	* nsd/tclobj.c:
	* nsd/tclmisc.c:  Updated Ns_Time type code to handle simple
	single-integer times without microsecond resolution.

	* include/ns.h:
	* include/Makefile.global:
	* Makefile:  Updated for AOLserver beta4 release to coincide
	with Tcl beta1 release.

	Otherwise, minor edits to new object commands in several
	places.
	
2002-07-05  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* nsd/nsd.h:
	* nsd/adpcmds.c:
	* nsd/adpeval.c:
	* nsd/adprequest.c:
	* nsd/tclcmds.c:  Updated remaining ADP commands to be
	object-based.  Because the NsInterp->adp struct now uses
	Tcl_Obj's for call frame args, the string commands were
	just dumped.

2002-06-25  Scott S. Goodwin <scott@scottg.net>

	* nsd/tclvar.c:
	* nsd/tclcmds.c: Reimplemented nsv commands as object commands.

2002-06-19  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* include/ns.h:
	* nsd/tclinit.c:  Added new Ns_TclCreateInterp() which
	creates and initializes interps for server and non-server
	interps (e.g., the config interp).  Interps are now
	initialized with a call to Tcl_Init() which enables the
	standard Tcl library procedures (e.g., unknown, http::,
	etc.).

	* nsd/tclthread.c:
	* nsd/tclcmds.c:  Thread and cache related commands no
	longer require a server, exposing them in any interp created
	with Ns_TclCreateInterp.
	
	* nsd/server.c:  NsGetServer handles NULL server.

	In general, the changes above are steps towards making the
	AOLserver API's more useful outside the context of a server.
	The idea is to enable use of libnsd for other applications,
	e.g., shells interps.

2002-06-12  Jeremy Collins <jeremy.collins@phpsource.net>

	* nsd/conn.c:
	* nsd/tclcmds.c: Reimplemented "ns_conn" as an obj based
	command.  In the process I also modified NsTclConnObjCmd to use
	Tcl_GetIndexFromObj.  This should improve performance as well as
	the readability of the code.

	* nsd/auth.c:
	* nsd/form.c:
	* nsd/httptime.c:
	* nsd/log.c:
	* nsd/mimetypes.c:
	* nsd/nsmain.c:
	* nsd/pathname.c:
	* nsd/random.c:
	* nsd/tclatclose.c:

	* nsd/tclrequest.c:
	* nsd/tclresp.c:
	* nsd/tclsock.c:
	* nsd/tclthread.c:
	* nsd/urlencode.c:
	* nsd/urlopen.c: Cleaned up the way we were setting the result
	on tcl errors.

2002-06-12  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>
	
	* include/nsthread.h:
	* nsthread/mutex.c:
	* nsthread/thread.c:
	* nsd/info.c:  Rename Ns_MutexEnum and Ns_ThreadEnum to
	Ns_MutexList and Ns_ThreadList to not conflict with pre-4.0
	definitions of removed functions.

	* nsthread/Makefile
	* nsthread/nshtreadtest.c (new file):  Added simple program
	to test thread interface.

	* nsthread/thread.h:
	* nsthread/cslock.c:
	* nsthread/rwlock.c:  Added new NsMutexInitNext function
	to consistantly name mutexes in internal objects.

	* nsthread/sema.c:  Restored AOLserver 3.x implementation
	using Ns_Mutex and Ns_Cond objects.  The API's in <semaphore.h>
	were not implemented on OS/X.

2002-06-10  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* include/Makefile.global:
	* include/Makefile.module:  Added support for dynamic
	library init procs set via the LIBINIT make variable.

	* nsd/proc.c:
	* nsd/sched.c:
	* nsd/server.c:
	* nsd/tclinit.c:
	* nsd/urlspace.c:  Various runtime initializations collected
	into dynamic library load time init via NsdInit in init.c.

2002-06-08  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* include/Makefile.global
	* include/Makefile.module:  Support for building programs
	along with dynamic libraries and modules.  Also, fixed bug
	setting -install_name on OS/X.

	* nsd/Makefile:  Use of updated Makefile.module and include
	osxcompat.o on OS/X.

	* nsd/nsd.h:
	* nsd/osxcompat.h:
	* nsd/osxcompat.c:  Compat functions moved from ../nsosx.

	* nsosx/README (removed):
	* nsosx/Makefile (removed):
	* nsosx/nsosx.c (removed):  Tcl no longer requires any
	compat functions, remainder moved into nsd.

	Otherwise, minor tweaks throughout to silence compiler
	warnings.

2002-06-05  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* Makefile:
	* include/Makefile.global:  Added tclmemdbg flag to compile
	Tcl and AOLserver with TCL_MEM_DEBUG option.

	* nsd/unix.o:
	* nsosx/README (new file):
	* nsosx/Makefile (new file):
	* nsosx/nsosx.o (new file):  Hacks for Apple OS/X removed
	from nsd/unix.o and moved to nsosx.o as a Tcl compat object.
	See README for instructions.

	* nsd/nsd.h:
	* nsd/server.c:
	* nsd/adpparse.c:
	* nsd/adpcmds.c:
	* nsd/adpeval.c:  Added support for new ns_adp_safeeval
	and ns_adp_registerproc commands. Also, registered tags
	can now be modified after startup.

	* include/Makefile.module:  Updated to allow building of
	dynamic library of public routines to go with dynamic
	module, e.g., libnsdb.so with nsdb.so.

	* nsext/Makefile:
	* nspd/Makefile:
	* nspd/msg.c (removed):
	* nsext/msg.c (moved from nspd):  Moved Ns_Ext API from
	libnspd.a static library to libnsext.so dynamic library as
	it's used by both nsext.so and proxy drivers.

	* nsdb/Makefile:
	* nsdb/nsext.c (new file):  Moved public API for nsdb out
	of nsdb.so module and into libnsdb.so dynamic library.

2002-05-15  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* Makefile:
	* include/Makefile.global:
	* tcl8.3.4 (removed):  As of Tcl version 8.4., no modifications
	to the Tcl sources are required for AOLserver.  Therefore,
	the hacked 8.3.4 sources have been removed.  Going forward
	you'll need to checkout the Tcl source from Sourceforge
	into the directory specified in include/Makefile.global
	(currently ../tcl8.4).  The top level Makefile includes
	the "tcl-checkout" and "tcl-update" targets which should
	help.
	
	* include/ns.h:
	* nsd/server.c:
	* nsd/nsd.h:
	* nsd/tclcmds.c:
	* nsd/tclinit.c:
	* nsd/init.tcl:

	* nsd/dbutil.c (removed):
	* nsdb/dbinit.c (new):
	* nsdb/dbdrv.c (new):
	* nsdb/dbtcl.c (new):
	* nsdb/dbutil.c (new):
	* include/nsdb.h (new):  Moved the NsDb interface from core
	to new nsdb module.  Simply loading nsdb.so should work as
	before.  Goal is to enable full replacement of NsDb in the
	future.

	* nsd/cache.c:
	* nsd/callbacks.c:
	* nsd/listen.c:
	* nsd/nsconf.c:
	* nsd/op.c:

	* nslog/nslog.c:
	* nslog/nslog.c:  Simple mutex name updates.

	* nscgi/nscgi.c:  Minor bug fixes

	* nsd/adpeval.c:  Fixed read of freed data.

	* nsd/tclinit.c:  Fixed crash bug of null interp delete.

	* nsd/exec.c:
	* include/Makefile.global:  Support for process manager
	thread enabled with -DUSE_PROCTHREAD to route all process
	create/wait through a single thread for Linux threads.

2002-02-24  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* nsd/nsd.h
	* nsd/unix.c:
	* tcl8.3.4/unix/tclLoadDyld.c: Hacks for routines missing
	from OS/X. The implementation of sigwait() is not strictly
	correct but appears good enough for AOLserver's use.

	* Makefile:
	* nsd/Makefile:
	* nsmain/Makefile:
	* include/Makefile.global:
	* include/Makefile.module:
	* include/Makefile.library (removed): Updates for linking
	modules against the nsd shared library and for library
	filenames which don't end in .so.

	* nsext/Makefile
	* nspd/Makefile: Moved proxy message code from nsext to
	nspd, now a static library.

	* nsd/main.c:
	* nsd/init.c:
	* nsd/Makefile:
	* nsmain/*:
	* sample-config.tcl:
	* tcl2ini.tcl:
	* ini2tcl.tcl:
	* Makefile: Moved build and install of nsd and init.tcl
	into nsd directory and install of sample config to top
	level Makefile.  Added tcl2ini.tcl and ini2tcl.tcl config
	file utilities.

2002-02-07  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* nsmain/init.tcl:
	* nsmain/sample-config.tcl:

	* tcl/sendmail.tcl:
	* tcl/util.tcl: code cleanup to brace exprs and fix indentation

2001-12-05  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* nsd/tclthread:  Tcl threads now return their string result
	via ns_thread wait.

2001-12-20  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* include/Makefile.library: Changed RFLAG to RPATH, and took out
	$(AOLSERVER)/lib:
	
	  $(LDSO) -o $(LIB) $(OBJS) $(LIBS) $(RFLAG) $(AOLSERVER)/lib

	now reads:
	
	  $(LDSO) -o $(LIB) $(OBJS) $(LIBS) $(RPATH)

	which is what I think was intended. Still have the problem
	that $(AOLSERVER)/lib must already exist.

2001-11-05  Jim Davidson <jgdavidson@aol.com>

	* Removed support for Win32, removing both the build/test
	environment and updating the code to be standard Unix style.
	Among other style changes such as changing SOCKET's to
	simple Unix style int's, the short lived Ns_Buf structure
	was also eliminated in favor of the Unix standard struct
	iovec.

	* Removed support for older non-pthread Unix platforms such
	as HP/10 and SGI native.

	* Updated Tcl to version to Tcl 8.3.4, replacing tclAlloc.c
	with a modified version of what was libnsthread's fast pool
	allocator including support for fast direct Tcl_Obj
	allocation.  Also added a few functions to tclUnixThrd.c
	for thread safety (e.g., readdir_r and localtime_r support)
	and fixed up tcl.m4 for better FreeBSD 4.4 and Solaris
	thread builds.

	* ns_malloc, Ns_ThreadMalloc, and Ns_PoolAlloc all now
	simply call Tcl_Alloc which is always enabled. The previous
	-z (enable) and -p (disable) command line flags are ignored.

	* Integrated remainder of libnsthread, now standard pthreads
	and compatible with Tcl pthread code, into libnsd.so.

	* Updated libnsd.so to use poll() instead of select() where
	possible.

	* Removed the code which would attempt to determine when
	the sock callbacks and scheduler were idle before completing
	startup.  The code was overly complex and not strictly
	correct.

	* Removed the -k and -K shutdown/restart options which was
	not entirely safe.

	* Removed the child-process privleged port Ns_SockListen
	code in nsd/binder.c.  Binding privleged ports (e.g., port
	80) now requires the -b or -B command line methods introduced
	in 3.4, e.g., "nsd -ft nsd.tcl -b myhost:80".  The binder
	code, while clever, was a potential security risk.

	* Cleaned up some lingering sloppy uses of Ns_ConfigGet
	and other older macros.  Old macro and function definitions
	can be disabled by defining NS_NOCOMPAT as is done when
	compiling the core server and modules.

	* Incremented version to 4.0b2.

2001-08-29  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* https.tcl: made fixes to ns_httppost per Rick Lansky at
	bom.com. He also suggested I allow the Content-type to be
	passed in as a parameter, so I've added that too.

2001-08-27  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* https.tcl: added ns_httppost, that is called with url,
	rqset, qsset and timeout. The qsset is an ns_set with
	key/values that will be turned into user=scottg&pass=1234,
	for example, and passed as content in the POST.

2001-08-17  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* tcl/http.tcl: moved rqset to be the last arg passed to
	ns_httpget so it wouldn't break existing code. I should
	have done it that way in the first place.

2001-08-15  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* tcl/http.tcl: add the rqset param as the second argument to
	ns_httpget, which in turn calls ns_httpsopen and passes the rqset
	to it. The change is for consistency so that you can use cookies
	with ns_httpget as well.

2001-07-16  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* tcl/http.tcl: you can now do ns_httpopen GET /index.html;
	the script will automatically prepend http://hostname:port/
	to the url.

2001-06-30  Dossy Shiobara  <scott@scottg.net>

	* nsd/conn.c, tests/api/ns_conn.adp: fixed ns_conn
	outputheaders as per bug #433676 submitted by Yon Derek
	(yond).

2001-05-22  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* nsd/conn.c: changed Ns_ConnDriverContext in 4.x to return
	the actual conn-specific, module-specific context back,
	which is how it works in 3.x. For some reason this API call
	was changed to always return NULL, but nsopenssl and
	potentially other comm drivers need to get their conn-specific
	info back.

2001-04-25  Dossy Shiobara  <dossy@panoptic.com>

	* Implemented [ns_localtime ?tz?] as per "[ #418890 ]
	ns_localtime should accept timezone".

2001-03-15  Dossy Shiobara  <dossy@panoptic.com>

	* include/Makefile.win32 win32/*/Makefile: initial attempts
	at Makefiles suitable for NMAKE for building on Win32

	* include/ns.h: define typedef __int64 INT64 for Win32

2001-03-12  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* nsmain.c: Segmentation fault when using -g <group> flag:
	line 294 should read Ns_GetGid(garg) instead of Ns_GetGid(optarg).

2001-03-12 Jim Davidson

	Initial checkin of AOLserver 4.0 (beta), now supporting
	vitual servers and (finally) removing supporting for Tcl
	7.6.
	
2001-03-08  Kris Rehberg

	*** AOLserver 3.3 RELEASED ***

2001-03-08 Jim Davidson

	* Added NsTclFinalizeThread() at end of Tcl TLS cleanup to
	finalize Tcl 8.x thread data.  This fix was the last hurdle
	for finalizing nsd8x.

2001-01-31  Kris Rehberg 

	* Makefile (MODULES): nsunix, nsvhr, and nsodbc moved to
	the Module Collection.

2001-01-16  Jim Davidson

	* Cleaned up sloppy use of the nsServer global wherever
	it's used.

2001-01-04  Kris Rehberg 

	* nsd/tclmisc.c: Ticket 13090.  ns_striphtml crashing-bug
	in nsd8x fixed.

2000-12-14  Kris Rehberg 

	* tcl/http.tcl: Corrected typo _ns_ns_http_readable.

	* nsd/dstring.c (Ns_DStringPrintf): Ticket 12765.
	Ns_DStringPrintf uses vsnprintf instead of vsprintf with
	specified buffer size.  Thanks to "??".

	* nsd/return.c (Ns_ConnConstructHeaders): Ticket 12764.
	If-Modified-Since (304) works with keepalive now. Thanks
	to Jim "??".

2000-12-13  Kris Rehberg 

	* include/Makefile.global: Builds with architecture-specific
	optimization options. Auto-detects architecture for most
	platforms.  Auto-select compiler and Purify usage from
	command line, e.g.:
	gmake nativeme=1   (all non-free Unix)
	gmake gccme=1      (some non-free Unix) gmake
	PURIFY=/path/to/purify/executable  (Solaris and Irix only)

	* nssock/Makefile*: now installs The Right Things in The
	Right Places.

	* nsd/Makefile: nsd8x is the default AOLserver now (nsd
	symlinks to nsd8x).

	* nsd/sample-config.tcl: Added some tuning parameters for
	easy reference.

2000-12-12  Kris Rehberg 

	* nsvhr/nsvhr.c (UDSProxy): More type changes.

	* nslog/nslog.c (Ns_ModuleInit): pointer-to-function casted.

	* nscp/nscp.c (GetLine): buf changed to char *; casted
	AcceptProc.
	
2000-12-12  Jim Davidson

	* nssock/sock.cpp: Fixed multiple-load problems, added
	sndbuf, rcvbuf, sendwait, and recvwait options. Added
	configurable backlog via Ns_SockListenEx. Fixed compile
	bugs for ssl. Restructured the socket module to wait in
	server busy situations instead of sending the server busy
	message.  Also, moved the graceful close burden to the
	SockThread from the connection thread.

	* thread/win32.cpp: Moved WinThread allocation to DllMain,
	eliminating GetWinThread function. Also, disabled thread
	cleanup for final thread to avoid any TLS cleanup callbacks
	attempting to invoke code in unloaded libraries like Tcl.
	Removed call to NsInitThread no longer needed. Switched to
	rolling condition broadcast wakeup as in the sproc code.
	More fixes for new Thread context model.
	
	* thread/tls.c: Changed NsLock API's to return 1/0 instead
	of NS_OK/NS_TIMEOUT and more use of Ns_MasterLock to keep
	things simple.

	* thread/thread.c: Changed thread enum to return Ns_Thread,
	not Ns_Thread pointer which didn't make much sense.  Updated
	"ns_info pools" command to reflect change. Fixed bugs with
	Ns_ThreadEnum and pool counters. Update of the Ns_Pool API
	to support more stats gathering available via new Ns_PoolStats
	API. Remove Thread->etime and NsPool API's. Moved sprintf
	of default thread name from NsThreadMain to NsInitThread
	under protection of threads lock. Added comment for
	NsInitThread. More fixes for new Thread context model.
	Updated sproc.cpp code for new Thread management and removed
	the wait for thread startup which shouldn't be needed.

	* thread/test.c: Cleaned up code a bit to quiet compiler.
	Better test for PTHREAD_TEST.  Fixed undefined var bug for
	sproc.  Added some comments, a native pthread test, and a
	recursive stack checker.

	* thread/tcl8x.c: Added Tcl_JoinThread for benefit of
	Tcl8.4.

	* thread/sproc.cpp: Changed NsLock API's to return 1/0
	instead of NS_OK/NS_TIMEOUT and more use of Ns_MasterLock
	to keep things simple. Fixed some comment bugs, update
	thrPtr->tid after fork. Added call the NsInitThread. Updated
	sproc.cpp code for new Thread management and removed the
	wait for thread startup which shouldn't be needed.

	* thread/pthread.cpp: Changed NsLock API's to return 1/0
	instead of NS_OK/NS_TIMEOUT and more use of Ns_MasterLock
	to keep things simple. Fixed bug of not setting the tid
	correctly. Added call the NsInitThread.

	* thread/pool.c: Added Ns_PoolEnum to get at pool stats as
	with mutexes and threads, removing the old Ns_PoolStats
	API's and updating the "ns_info pools" command. Fixed bugs
	with Ns_ThreadEnum and pool counters. Update of the Ns_Pool
	API to support more stats gathering available via new
	Ns_PoolStats API. Removed <mutex.h> for sgi which shouldn't
	have been there. Removed the sbrk() code for now, was
	crashing SGI (probably not thread safe). Use sbrk() on Unix
	instead of malloc to avoid any malloc overhead or contention.
	Reduced the zippy allocator page size to 16k from 64k.

	* thread/pool.c, thread.c, sproc.cpp: Re-structured management
	of the Thread context to better support threads created
	without Ns_ThreadCreate (e.g., Java VM threads).
	
	* thread/mutex.c: Changed NsLock API's to return 1/0 instead
	of NS_OK/NS_TIMEOUT and more use of Ns_MasterLock to keep
	things simple.

	* thread/cs.c, memory.c, mutex.c, pool.c, pthread.cpp,
	reentrant.c, rwlock.c, sema.c, sproc.cpp, tcl8x.c, test.c,
	thread.c, win32.cpp: Restructured the thread interfaces,
	moving the master lock to the platform interface code,
	integrating the zippy allocator with Ns_Pool/Ns_ThreadAlloc
	and use of a new simple direct allocator for all thread
	objects.

	* win32/nsthread/nsthread.dsp: Removed master.c and
	oldpools.c.

	* nsd/unix.c: Made ns_eval command disabled by default to
	avoid using SIGUSR2.

	* nsd/tclthread.c: Changed SETOBJ macro to SetObj function
	which no longer sprintf's directly into interp->result.

	* nsd/tclmisc.c: Added Ns_PoolEnum to get at pool stats as
	with mutexes and threads, removing the old Ns_PoolStats
	API's and updating the "ns_info pools" command. Changed
	thread enum to return Ns_Thread, not Ns_Thread pointer
	which didn't make much sense.  Updated "ns_info pools"
	command to reflect change.  Added more info for "ns_info
	pools".  Added "ns_info pools" command to dump memory pool
	stats.
	
	* nsd/tclinit.c: Added nsconf.quiet and nsconf.startuptimeout.
	Made ns_eval command disabled by default to avoid using
	SIGUSR2.  Added nsConfQuiet flag to quiet down the startup
	messages with the -q flag.

	* nsd/sock.c: Added Ns_SockListenEx.

	* nsd/serv.c: Ensured the conn thread name was set first.
	Added Ns_RegisterAtReady callbacks for indicating server
	no longer busy.

	* nsd/sched.c, nsmain.c, serv.c, sockcallback.c: Added code
	to wait for conn thread, sock callback, and sched idle at
	startup to help alleviate code start problems.

	* nsd/nsmain.c: Shuffled initialization to ensure command
	line args are read before calling any Ns API's, ensuring
	zippy malloc can be set if needed.

	* nsd/nsconf.c: Added nsconf.quiet and nsconf.startuptimeout.
	Made ns_eval command disabled by default to avoid using
	SIGUSR2.

	* nsd/dstring.c: Remove unused vars.  Uses ns_realloc to
	grow strings and maintains dstring stack in the staticSpace
	instead of the *addr pointer for compatibility with Tcl
	dstrings.

	* nsd/callbacks.c: Added Ns_RegisterAtReady callbacks for
	indicating server no longer busy.

	* nsd/binder.c: Added Ns_SockListenEx.

2000-12-12  Kris Rehberg 
	
	* nsvhr/nsvhr.c (VHRProc): Matches hostnames regardless of
	case.

	* nssock: Supports Rainbow CryptoSwift SSL accelerators
	(compile-time option; requires the Swift SDK from
	http://www.rainbow.com/).

	* nsd/nsmain.c (Ns_Main): Changed order of some config
	default initialization.  Config options cleaned up a lot.
	Usage message very less glib.  SUNWspro dumped core on
	usage message due to nsconf.argv0 quigglyness.
	
2000-10-20  Kris Rehberg 

	*** AOLserver 3.2 RELEASED ***

2000-10-20  Jim Davidson

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Fixed deadlock in sockets init code.

	* nsd/nswin32.c: Fixed service install code to allow long
	pathnames with spaces.  Added/use ns_pipe which set's
	close-on-exec like ns_sockpair.
	

2000-10-17  Kris Rehberg 

	* nssock/sock.cpp: extra padding on Server Busy message to
	defeat MSIE friendly error messages.

	* nsd/nsconf.h: All configuration option defaults have been
	moved to nsconf.h as #defines.

	* Makefile (install): Tcl library for nsd8x is now installed
	into $(PREFIX)/lib/tcl8.3.

	* tcl/http.tcl (ns_httpopen): Host:port is now sent to
	remote host if != 80.  Suggested by Jerry Asher.

	* tcl/fastpath.tcl (_ns_dirlist): All kinds of Win32
	pathnames should now be working.  Thanks to Eric Klein.

	* nsd/return.c (Ns_ConnReturnNotice): New options
	"errorminsize", to pad error messages to defeat MSIE friendly
	errors (fix suggested by ArsDigita) and "noticedetail" to
	return more detailed information on notice pages.

	* nslog/nslog.c: suppressquery option added to suppress
	logging of query data.

	* nslog/nslog.c: LogExtendedHEaders option added.  Contributed
	by ArsDigita.


	* nsd/tclfile.c: Input string to mktemp is copied, because
	mktemp edits the string in-place and that's generally a
	bad thing to do with argv's.  Contributed by ArsDigita.

	* nsd/tclnsshare.cpp (ShareTraceProc): Patch to tclnsshare.cpp
	to avoid race conditions if the shared value is a list.
	Contributed by ArsDigita.

	* tcl/http.tcl (ns_httpopen): CRLF now returned in ns_httpopen.
	Contributed by ArsDigita.

	* tcl8.3.2/generic/tclCmdIL.c: Nonsense case of lsorting
	a list with length <= 0 caused a memory leak.  Fixed.
	Contributed by ArsDigita.
	
	* nsd/adpfancy.c: We now use the Arsdigita version of
	adpfancy.  Contributed by ArsDigita.
	
	* nsd/adp.c: Sundry ArsDigita changes.

2000-10-16  Kris Rehberg 

	* tcl/init.tcl:  Initialize errorCode and errorInfo like
	tclsh does.  From ArsDigita.

	* nsd/nsd.h, nsd/tclcmds.c, nsd/tclvar.c: nsv_names Tcl
	command lists names of nsv's in memory.

	* tcl8.3.2: The complete Tcl 8.x distributions are now
	included.  They aren't installed with AOLserver's "gmake
	install", but you can install them manually if you want to
	use them for the i18n encodings and stuff like that.  It
	will install into the "lib/tcl8.3" directory of the binary
	distribution with AOLserver 3.3 and later.

	* nsd/nsmain.c (Ns_Main): Had to move Ns_ThreadSetName
	below the stdin/stdout/stderr reassignment to fix a fd
	problem with running nsd on Irix in "installed" or "daemon"
	mode that would prevent the server from starting up.  Sigh.
	(Ns_Main): Took out little note about -k|-K being deprecated.

2000-10-13  Kris Rehberg 

	* nsd/nsmain.c (Ns_Main): gid of the specified user is set even if
	it's not specified.
	(UsageError): -K and -k give a "deprecated" warning.
	(Ns_Main): -f gives a "deprecated" warning.

	* nsd/binder.c (PreBind): Didn't really tell us if it was
	successful at pre-binding.  Helpful to know if you're
	wondering what happened to that port you wanted to pre-bind.
	(Binder): backlog variables (2) initialized to nsconf.backlog.

	* nssock/sock.cpp, nsd/return.c: Made an attempt at
	standardizing the error codes and error page content.
	
2000-10-13  Jim Davidson
	
	* sproc.cpp: Fixed Wakeup() error message and update child's
	sproc pid after fork.

	* nsd/random.c: Put back log message when generating seeds.

	* nsd/nsconf.c: Fixed memory overwrite bug in stats and
	increased the default buffer value.

	* nsd/keepalive.c: Fixed array overwrite with maxkeep=0
	bug.  Contributed by ArsDigita.
	
	* nsd/tclkeylist.c: A more modern version added that's
	compatible with Tcl 8.3.2 (nsd8x).

	* nsd/stamp.c: Forces the build date reported by AOLserver
	to be absolutely the last possible moment before the link
	step happens, not just the last time nsmain.c was built.

	* nsd/binder.c: New option "-b" to prebind ports as root
	(but not listen on them).  This allows AOLserver to start
	up on MacOS X on ports 80 and 443 like this:  "nsd ..blah..
	-b 10.0.0.1:80".

	* nssock/: Building nsssl is much less of a debacle and
	doesn't rebuild itself three times anymore.

	* various: fork() calls in all kinds of code were changed
	to use ns_fork.  ns_fork now lives in the thread library
	(thread/ directory).

	* tcl8.3.2/generic/tclIO.c: Fixed memory leak that leaks
	around 112 bytes each time a file descriptor is closed.
	Thanks to Rob Mayoff for finding this and proposing a
	solution.

2000-10-09  Kris Rehberg 

	* sample-config.tcl: nsd.tcl is now sample-config.tcl so
	that existing users can look at the new reference configuration.

	* nsd/nsmain.c (Ns_InfoNameOfExecutable): new function just
	returns nsconf.nsd which is determined elsewhere.

	* nscp/nscp.c (Login): Tells you lots of harmless info
	about the machine once you log in.  Also, nscp does not
	run unless configuration is explicitly set

	* nsd/nsmain.c: Some typo or other.

	* General: Files were re-arranged and some were renamed.
	The sample SSL key/cert files are sample-certfile,
	sample-keyfile.  The nsd.tcl is now called sample-config.tcl
	(so that existing installations always have a current
	reference copy of the configuration).  Other minor changes.

	* tests/:  Moved from its hiding place in scripts/test.
	Install them with "gmake install-tests".

	* nsd/tclxkeylist.c, nsd/tclcmds.c, nsd/Makefile: Re-added
	TclX keyl* commands that were in AOLserver 2.x.  These are
	inferior to ns_set which is why they were left out in the
	first place.

2000-10-04  Jim Davidson

	* binder.c: Set close-on-exec on received fd from binder.
	
	* sock.c: Removed cthread errno API's, Mac OS X now has
	thread-safe errno.

	* nsd/nsmain.c, include/Makefile.global, nsd/nsthread.h,
	nspd/main.c, nsunix/nsunix.c, nsvhr/nsvhr.c, thread/Makefile,
	thread/osthread, thread/reentrant.c, thread/signal.c:
	Updates for Mac OS X.  Use MACOSX instead of APPLE; use
	HAVE_BSDSETPGRP, HAVE_CMMSG, use pthreads instead of
	cthreads.
	
	* nssock/sock.c: Removed setting bufsize to uninitialized
	value on ssl.

	* include/ns.h: Removed Ns_CacheTimedGetValue which was an
	odd interface not used anywhere.
	
	* nsd/nsd.h: Update to version 3.11.
	
	* tcl/namespace.tcl: Added namespace export to init script.
	
	* thread/pthread.cpp: Stopped using pthread_once as it
	appears to require a lock.
	
2000-10-04  Kris Rehberg 

	* win32/nsssl/nsssl.dsp: nsssl project for win32.

	* win32/aolserver.dsw: main installation keeps DLL's as
	DLL's now.

	* scripts/nsd.tcl: shared library extension is now
	platform-dependent

	* nssock/ssltcl.c: Changed name of ReadFile adn WriteFile
	to avoid Win32 naming conflicts.
	
2000-09-28  Kris Rehberg 

	* scripts/tests/nstelemetry.adp: added "Expires: now" header
	to ensure it gets run each time it's visitted.

	* nsd/serv.c (NsConnArgProc): Race condition when threads
	exit while [ns_info threads] is run; arg can be NULL.  Seen
	mostly by people who regularly visit nstelemetry.adp.
	(AppendConn): same thing but with connPtr.  This may be a
	losing battle.  It appears to work on a busy Irix server,
	so I'm declaring victory for now.

2000-09-28  Jim Davidson
	
	* nssock/sock.c: Fixed bufferred read code in SockRead,
	resulting in a big performance boost and system load
	reduction.  Special thanks to Zachary Girouard.

2000-09-05  Kris Rehberg 

	*** AOLserver 3.1 Released *** 

2000-09-05  (various: Jerry Asher, Jim Davidson, "Dossy," Curtis Galloway,
	Scott S. Goodwin, Rob Mayoff, Kris Rehberg)

	* thread/win32.cpp: Sets thread stack size as on other
	platforms.

	* thread/thread.c: NULL out thread arg at exit to avoid
	Ns_ThreadEnum checking arg info for possibly deallocated
	context as seen in ns_info threads.  Also, moved read of
	firstPtr in Ns_ThreadEnum inside lock.  Added Ns_ThreadCreate2
	in thread.c needed for upgrade to Tcl 8.3.1 in tcl8x.c
	
	* thread/pthread.cpp: ETIME bug work around not causes
	wakeup in Ns_CondWait and Ns_CondTimeWait instead of waiting
	again.  This is more conservative and should avoid problems
	some have had with threads missing wakeup.

	* thread/pool.c: Added a simple 1-byte range check to -z
	allocator.

	* thread/Makefile: Added dependency for osthread.o to
	Makefile.

	* tcl/namespace.tcl: Added namespace export to init script.

	* nsvhr/nsvhr.c: Switched to Ns_WriteConn in TimedSockDump
	to ensure all data was sent.

	* nssock(nsssl): SSL module includes a fake 40-bit/512-bit
	export-grade SSL keyfile.pem and certfile.pem for immediate
	use on installation.  Adjusted for use with BSAFE 4 and 5.

	* nspd: Library now installed to binary distribution.

	* nsd/tclsock.c: Fixed crash bug in error message in
	ns_socknread.

	* nsd/tclcmds.c: Added ns_adp_registertag command as
	documented.
	
	* nsd/serv.c: Added missing break for unauthorized case in
	ConnRun.

	* nsd/random.c: Fixed deadlock between Ns_DRand/Ns_GenSeeds.
	
	* nsd/nsmain.c: Fixed some message formatting problems.

	* nsd/mimetypes.c: Added .png type, "image/png".
	
	* nsd/dbtcl.c: Removed unused variables in GetCsvCmd.  Use
	a dstring to create the column list instead of incrementally
	setting the output variable with Tcl_SetVar.  This was
	necessary to avoid conflicting definitions of the needed
	TCL_ flags between 7.6 and 8.x.

	* nsd/dbinit.c: MOdified current per-thread handle count
	to use a single TLS slot instead of a slot per pool.
	
	* nsd/tclinit.c,adp.c,conn.c: The use of thread-local
	storage (Tls) is now self-initializing in the conn, ADP,
	Tcl, etc.  This allows ns_conn commands to be used outside
	a connection thread as well as other uses of Tls where it
	may not be ready for use.

	* nscp/nscp.c: Password non-echo code confuses Win32 and
	some free Unix telnet clients so it has been disabled by
	default for now, though it can be enabled by setting
	"echopassword" in the nscp module section of nsd.tcl.
	
2000-08-21  Kris Rehberg 

	* nscp/nscp.c: Makes some attempt to recognize and handle
	telnet IAC codes like CTRL-C and CTRL-D to force a logout.
	This implementation of the telnet protocol is dirt-cheap,
	so only standard Unix telnet is supported.  On Win32, IAC
	handling is completely disabled because the client is too
	chatty with its IAC codes.

2000-08-20  Kris Rehberg 

	* nsftp, nspostgres, nssolid, nssybpd moved to $TOP level.

2000-08-17  Jim Davidson

	* nsd/dbtcl: Removed unused variables in GetCsvCmd.
	
	* nsd/adp.c: Fixed bug of not truncating output buffer when
	an error was thrown during an ns_adp_parse.  Fix suggested
	by Rob Mayoff.

	* tcl7.6 and tcl8.2.3: Switched to blocking Tcl_WaitPid to
	avoid zombies as suggested by Rob Mayoff.
	
	* thread: NULL out thread arg at exit to avoid Ns_ThreadEnum
	checking arg info for possibly deallocated context as seen
	in ns_info threads.  Also, moved read of firstPtr in
	Ns_ThreadEnum inside lock.
	
2000-08-17  Kris Rehberg 
	
	* nssock/sock.c (SockThread): warning sent to log when
	Server Busy is returned.

	* All the Makefiles should be in line with each other.
	Typing "gmake", "gmake install" and "gmake clean" should
	work in any directory.  NSHOME is paid attention to by all
	Makefiles.

	* nsd: Ns_Log and Ns_Fatal statements are hopefully more
	standardized and more useful to admins and developers.

	* Irix now builds as -o32 using the native compiler by
	default.  See Makefile.global on how to change.

2000-08-15  Kris Rehberg 

	* include/Makefile.global (INSTLOG): should have pointed
	to $(INST)/lib, not $(INST)/modules/lib.

	* Makefile: nsunix resurrected.  All modules are built.
	If a module is missing a library, it is not built, but it
	won't stop the AOLserver build process (no error is thrown).
	The build will continue with the next module.
	
	* nsftp: guesses if you have TCP_WRAPPERS available.

	* nsext: Ten guesses why $(NSHOME)/include/nsextmsg.h was
	duplicated here.

	* nssybpd: Hopefully, the log statements will be easier to
	understand by both admins and developers.  It's still messy
	since it uses syslog.  Makefile redone to use standard
	AOLserver rules.  RPATH is used a little more intelligently.
	Removed files that had no business living there.
	
	* include/Makefile.global: Took stab at RPATH support on
	Solaris to perhaps remove the need for LD_LIBRARY_PATH on
	an intelligenly-administered system.  New rule for libnspd.a.
	
	
2000-08-14  Kris Rehberg 

	* Makefile: nsvhr has been resurrected and enjoys our full
	support.

	* nsexample/Makefile: The include at the bottom wasn't using
	$(NSHOME).

2000-08-14  Jim Davidson

	* Tcl 8.x library upgraded to tcl8.3.2.

	* thread/pool.c: A spiffy range-checker added to the Zippy
	(-z) memory allocator.

2000-08-11  Kris Rehberg 

	* nsvhr/nsvhr.c: Always add "Connection: close" to the
	request line to satisfy HTTP 1.1 RFC -- this would break
	MSIE in HTTP 1.1 mode.  HTTP_EOL of "\r\n" used on all
	request lines for stupid web servers on the other end.
	Protocol "tcp" added as synonym of "http" for old-time Unix
	heads.  Lots of folks lended a hand on this one -- Satyam
	Priyadarshy, Jerry Asher, Kriston Rehberg, and special
	thanks to Wanda G. at AOL for adding a CNAME in DNS so
	quickly.

2000-08-09  Kris Rehberg 

	* nsd/serv.c: A whole lot less chatty about conns starting
	and exiting.  If you want to see them, turn on the Debug
	flag.

	* doc/*: lots of updates.  Title page extremely simplified.
	SSL docs updated.  Release notes updated.  NSV docs corrected
	(thanks to Todd Levy.

2000-08-09  Jim Davidson
	
	* tcl7.6/generic/tclFHandle.c: Removed needed fileTable
	which could result in crashes when fd's where reused quickly
	[fixes a rare multiple-exec crashing bug in nsd76 --kris].

	* thread/tcl8x.c: Added a wrapper startup for Tcl_CreateThread
	for the benefit of Win32.

	* nsd/log.c: Removed severityRank array.

	* nsd/tclmisc.c: Fixed bug with ns_info pid. [I can't code --kris]
	
	* nsd: keepalive.c,nsmain.c,sched.c,serv.c: Re-ordered
	shutdowns to ensure connection threads are stopped before
	other shutdowns begin (e.g., sched, sockcallback).
	
	* tcl8.3.1 replaces tcl8.3.0.  README.AOLSERVER added to
	tcl8.3.1 directory.  Original copies of changed are named
	*.orig.

	* include/Makefile.global: Build environment now uses gcc
	-shared -nostartfiles as the default LDSO.

	* nsthread/thread.c: Added Ns_ThreadCreate2 with extra
	flags argument used by Tcl_CreateThread to create a detached
	thread.
	
2000-08-06  Scott S. Goodwin

	* nsd/log.c: Segmentation fault was occuring when writing
	to the log file because file pointer was being assigned to
	incorrectly - it wasn't NULL and it wasn't a valid address
	within processes memory. Fixed.

2000-08-06  Scott S. Goodwin

	* nssock: You can now compile with BSAFE versions 4 and 5.
	You'll need to specify the path to your BSAFE libaries and
	the BSAFE version in the nssock/Makefile before compiling.
	If you don't have BSAFE and want to compile without SSL at
	all, edit the toplevel Makefile and take out all the "SSL=1"
	text. The files changed were nssock/Makefile and
	nssock/t_stdlib.c.

2000-08-02  Kris Rehberg 

	* Build process is a little more rule-oriented.  The cleaning
	rules "distclean" and "clobber" were removed.  The Tcl
	libraries are always distcleaned when "gmake clean" is
	invoked.  Rules that can be used as dependencies were made
	for libnsthread and the Tcl libraries -- their names are
	"libnsthread," "libtcl76," and "libtcl8x," respectively.
	PREFIX is now used as the installation directory (along
	with INST), so the more familiar "gmake install
	PREFIX=/usr/local/aolserver" will work.  Additionally,
	gmaking in a subdirectory with dependencies now works.
	
	* nsd/log.c: The sourge of modlog has been removed.  All
	code included with AOLserver that used Ns_ModLog now doesn't.
	Many log statements are now hopefully more standardized.
	This will be a continuing improvement over the next several
	updates.  I would like to use gcc's __FUNCTION__ macro but
	it doesn't work on native compilers, but we may start using
	__LINE__ and __FILE__ instead or replace Ns_Log with a
	smart macro that takes care of all this stuff for us.

	* nsd/tclmisc.c (NsTclInfoCmd): ns_info pid added to return
	the process id.

2000-08-01  Kris Rehberg 

	* nsd/adp.c (Ns_AdpRequest): The enableexpire option was
	putting an Expires header even if it already existed.

	* nsd/return.c (Ns_ConnReturnNotice): Yikes, /face should
	have been /font.  No more fonts, colors, etc, on default
	notice pages.

	* nsd/tclsock.c (NsTclSockOpenCmd): Removed spurious Ns_Log
	Notice from ns_sockopen.

	* tcl/form.tcl (ns_getform): MSIE presents the wrong stuff
	to the server when a multipart/formdata POST is redirected.
	Workaround contributed by Joseph Bank.

	* tcl/fastpath.tcl (_ns_dirlist): base href removed --
	links are now fully-qualified.

	* Makefile (install): include and lib dirs are now included
	in binary distribution.

	* tcl/http.tcl (_ns_http_gets): \n replaced by \r in all
	but _ns_http_gets so that arbitrary headers get set correctly.

	* tcl7.6/generic/tclPosixStr.c (Tcl_SignalMsg): Patch to
	Tcl 7.6 for Red Hat on SPARC architectures.  Contributed
	by Mike Chan.

2000-07-13  Kris Rehberg 

	* scripts/nsd.tcl: nssslmodule names the nsssl/nsssle
	binary's filename.  nscp_port tells nscp what port to
	listen.

	* nssock: nssock.c renamed sock.c, SSL support has been
	merged back with nssock so that both nsssl and nssock use
	identical socket code.
	
	* nsssl2: directory removed; nsssl is in the nssock directory
	now.

2000-05-09  Kris Rehberg 

	* Re-added doc directory which has had the online docs
	removed.

2000-05-02  Kris Rehberg 

	* Makefile, include/Makefile.global, include/Makefile.module,
	nsexample/Makefile: Now uses NSHOME variable to locate
	AOLserver.  NSHOME is automatically figured out in the
	top-level Makefile and all the lower Makefiles still use
	relative directory paths.  The intention of NSHOME is for
	modules that do NOT live in the AOLserver source directory
	tree.  The nsexample/Makefile explains how this works.

	* nsftp module added.  Contributed by Eric O'Laughlen.

2000-04-12  Kris Rehberg 

	*** AOLserver 3.0 FINAL Released ***

<h3><a name="Getting_AOLserver"></a>Getting AOLserver</h3>
AOLserver binary builds for many platforms are at <a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com/</a><br>
<br>
AOLserver is open-source. The source code is hosted at Source Forge and can

 be found at the following locations:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com/</a></li>
  <li>In CVS at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/aolserver/">http://sourceforge.net/project/aolserver/</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Building_AOLserver"></a>Building AOLserver</h3>
AOLserver builds very easily and the <a href="install.html">Installation</a>document

 describes the process.&nbsp; We recommend that you use the defaults in include/Makefile.global

 when building your module.&nbsp; This file contains rules and knows how to build

 modules properly for all platforms AOLserver has been ported to. To link

 a shared object, we recommend the default which is:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>gcc -shared -nostartfiles</tt><br>
<br>
On some Solaris installations the Cygnus compiler is unable to build working

 shared objects.&nbsp; We're told that if you put the -Wl,-E option in the nsd/Makefile

 when linking the executable, Cygnus works, but we have not verified this

 successfully.&nbsp; GCC from just about anywhere else <i>will</i>work. You can

 get a pre-built copy of GCC 2.95.2 from <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/">http://www.sunfreeware.com/</a>or

 build your own from <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/</a>. Just install

 it and put a link to the new gcc in /usr/local/bin (keep the broken Cygnus

 in /usr/cygnus/bin in case you need it).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
HINT: The magic option to GCC for the compiling step is "-fPIC", so if you're

 using a third-party library, make sure "-fPIC" appears in the CFLAGS. And,

 to eliminate the possibility of strange behavior, it's helpful but not necessary

 to build everything with the same compiler and using the same options.&nbsp;

 If you're using a third-party library for which no source code is available,

 you may run into problems if the vendor did not build it with the equivalent

 of "-fPIC" on their compiler.&nbsp; Shared objects must be position-independent.

<h3><a name="Obtaining_the_128bit_SSL_Module"></a>Obtaining the 128-bit SSL Module</h3>
AOLserver supports two levels of SSL for "https" connections -- the export

 version, which has a 40-bit secret key and a 512-bit public keypair, and

 the domestic version, which has a 128-bit secret key and a 1024-bit public

 key.<br>
<br>
The 128-bit/1024-bit domestic version can be requested by sending mail to&nbsp;
 nsssl-request@aolserver.com.&nbsp; We are not allowed to give this software to
 anyone but citizens or naturalized citizens of the United States.&nbsp; You are
 not allowed to give it to people outside the USA or who are nationals of
 countries embargoed by the United States Government.<br>
<br>
The 40-bit/512-bit version can be found at <a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com/</a>as
 part&nbsp; of the regular AOLserver source and binary distributions.

<h3><a name="Installing_AOLserver"></a>Installing AOLserver</h3>
Installing AOLserver is very straightforward and is covered in the <a href="install.html">Installation</a>document.<br>
<h3><a name="Database_Access"></a>Database Access</h3>
AOLserver works with a great many databases including all the popular enterprise

 systems.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><b>Sybase Proxy Daemon (nssybpd)</b><br>
  <br>
The nssybpd connects AOLserver to a Sybase database. America Online does&nbsp;
 not have a license to distribute the binary builds of this code externally&nbsp;
 (and neither does anyone else).&nbsp; The source code is located in the "nssybpd/"&nbsp;
 directory of the AOLserver source tree at Source Forge and requires the&nbsp;
 Sybase Client Libraries to build.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="Getting_Help"></a>Getting Help</h3>
AOLserver has an active developer community as well as a very active user

 community.&nbsp; Links to these areas are at <a href="http://aolserver.com/help/">http://aolserver.com/help/</a>.

<h3><a name="Contributing_Software"></a>Contributing Software</h3>
AOLserver is extremely extensible and we host a great many community-contributed&nbsp;
 modules at <a href="http://aolserver.com/modules/">http://aolserver.com/modules/</a>.&nbsp; You&nbsp;
 can contribute your software by following the guidelines on that page.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Contributing_Patches"></a>Contributing Patches</h3>
We accept any form of patches at bugs@aolserver.com.&nbsp; We request that your
 patch include a test case and, if possible, a context diff against a tagged
 version of the AOLserver source code.&nbsp; In lieu of a test case we can also
 accept a narrative describing the problem in detail.<br>

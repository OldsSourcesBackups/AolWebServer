<h2>AOLserver Tuning Guide</h2>
AOLserver is immensely scalable because it has to be.&nbsp; It is the web server
 for the most heavily-used production environment in the world -- AOL.<br>
<br>
<h3>Only load modules you need</h3>
Modules like "nsperm" register extra requests that are checked on each connection,
 for example.&nbsp; Other modules like nscgi and nscp do not need to be loaded
 if you're not actually using CGI or the control port, respectively.<br>
<h3>Turn off DNS lookups wherever possible</h3>
The nslog module has these turned off by default, but it helps to see if
 it your configuration has it turned off.&nbsp; Also, the nsperm module uses DNS
 lookups for access control -- turn this off if you don't use host access
 control rules with nsperm.&nbsp; The nscgi module also can use DNS but, again,
 it's off by default (gethostbyaddr setting).&nbsp; If you must use DNS, AOLserver
 has a DNS cache that can be tweaked -- see "dnscache" and "dnscachetimeout"
 in the config reference.<br>
<h3>Use the standard ADP parser</h3>
The default parser is fully functional but leaves out thing such as registered
 ADP tags and the "SCRIPT" tag.&nbsp; The default parser is much more efficient
 than the fancy parser and should be used on heavily-loaded sites.&nbsp; In the
 ns/server/servername/adp/parsers section, only 'ns_param adp ".adp"' should
 be listed.<br>
<h3>Experiment with the ADP cache</h3>
In the ns/server/servername/adp section, the parameters are "cache", "cachesize",
 and "threadcache".&nbsp; AOLserver defaults to a 5-megabyte cache.&nbsp; This cache
 is used to store parsed ADP pages -- this means that ADP scripts are only
 parsed once and every subsequent time they are run directly out of memory.&nbsp;
 This means, though, that you should have a fair amount of core memory on
 your system to accomodate the cache if you decide to make it very large.<br>
<h3>Experiment with the FastPath cache</h3>
This is a separate cache used to store static HTML pages.&nbsp; The section is
 ns/server/servername/fastpath, and the optionjs are "cache", "cachemaxentry",
 and "cachemaxsize".&nbsp; Like the ADP cache, this defaults to 5 megabytes.&nbsp;
 On some systems enabling the "mmap" parameter can make it work even faster.<br>
<h3>Disable CheckModifiedSince</h3>
Is your site updated rarely or often?&nbsp; On some slower systems, setting "checkmodifiedsince"
 to false in the "ns/server/servername" section can speed up things considerably
 as AOLserver reads all scripts and data directly from the in-memory cache
 without checking to see if the file has changed each time a cache entry
 is hit.<br>
<h3>Tune the Threads</h3>
Thread settings are sometimes helpful, sometimes not.&nbsp; In ns/server/servername,
 the options are "connsperthread", "flushcontent", "maxconnections", "maxdropped",
 "maxthreads", "minthreads" and "threadtimeout.&nbsp; In nearly all cases the
 defaults are optimal, with the exception of maxthreads which should be carefully
 adjusted based on your load.&nbsp; Along with "maxthreads", the "maxconnections"
 setting can be tricky, since making it too large can cause your system to
 thrash.
<h3>Monitor the Memory</h3>
Memory considerations are paramount on heavily-used servers.&nbsp; Use the "ps
 -leaf" on most systems to look at the "nsd" processes.&nbsp; Nearly all the memory
 used by nsd should be in RSS (resident set size).&nbsp; If the nsd process' RSS
 is less than 2/3 its SZ, then it's a good chance that your operating system
 is thrashing, meaning it's spending more time managing memory than allowing
 the system to work to its capacity.&nbsp; Some operating systems actually limit
 the total RSS used by any one process.&nbsp; That<br>
1-gigabyte machine might only allow AOLserver to use 500 megabytes of core
 at any one time -- this is especially the case with SGI servers.<br>
<h3>Beware the Database</h3>
Databases are a bottleneck.&nbsp; Do you use lots of simple queries that return
 a hoard of data?&nbsp; Investigate using stored procedures or finely-tuned queries
 so that you get only the data you actually want and make the database do
 the work it was designed to do.&nbsp; Don't make your system spend its time putting
 together those ns_getrow structures.
<h3>Collect metrics and use them</h3>
AOLserver has a built-in statistics-gathering system that collects data on
 the caches, tcl interps, threads, and other interesting data.&nbsp; We use these
 at AOL to gather an immense amount of data on how the systems are working
 and where they need to be improved (more cache, less cache, more memory,
 more threads, etc). &nbsp; The file "nstelemetry.adp" can be dropped into any
 running server to get a snapshot of how it's doing.&nbsp; The "nstelemetry.adp"
 file can be found in the tests/ directory of the AOLserver Source Distribution.<br>

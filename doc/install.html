<h2>Building, Installing, and Configuring AOLserver</h2>
<pre>$Header$
</pre>
<p>AOLserver is distributed in source form.&nbsp; Pre-built binary kits for many

 platforms are available at <a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com/</a>.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
AOLserver 3 is reasonably portable and
known to compile and run on the following



 platforms:



<ul>
  <li>Linux 2.2 and better (x86 and others)
</li>
  <li>FreeBSD 3.4 and better (x86 and others)
</li>
  <li>OpenBSD 2.5 and better (x86 and others)
</li>
  <li>Solaris 2.x and better (SPARC and x86)
</li>
  <li>IRIX 6.x (mips)
</li>
  <li>HP/UX 10 and 11 (hppa)
</li>
  <li>DEC Tru64 &amp;OSF/1 4.0 and better (alpha)
</li>
  <li>UnixWare 7.x and better (x86)
</li>
  <li>Apple OS/X "Darwin" (first consumer beta release only) (ppc) </li>
</ul>
<p>It's likely AOLserver can compile on other systems and/or higher or&nbsp; lower

 numbered versions but this has not been extensively tested.&nbsp; The primary

 development platforms for AOLserver at AOL are IRIX 6.4&nbsp; and Solaris 7.&nbsp;

 We also use HP/UX 10.20/11.0, Solaris 2.6, and VA Linux 6.2.1 (Linux 2.2).</p>
<p>You will need a <b>C compiler</b>.&nbsp; The best one to use is GNU GCC from

 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a>and its mirrors.&nbsp; The versions

 we use are 2.95.2.&nbsp; AOLserver (and the&nbsp; included Tcl libraries) are written

 entirely
in ANSI standard C.</p>
<p><b>GNU make</b>is also required.&nbsp; It is also available from the GNU web

 site.</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
We've tried to make building AOLserver as simple as possible.&nbsp; On the supported

 platforms, simply typing "<b>gmake</b>" will build the server and its standard

 modules.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Check the include/Makefile.global file for platform-specific options.&nbsp;

 Most platforms use gcc.</li>
  <li>Enable optional modules.&nbsp; The default Makefile builds nssock, nsssl,

 nscgi,
nscp, nslog, nsperm, and nsext.</li>
  <li>Type "<tt>gmake</tt>", ensuring the make which is executed is GNU make.&nbsp;

 You might want to call your GNU Make "gmake" instead of "make".</li>
  <li>Watch for any warnings.&nbsp; The warning for a missing third-party library

 in nsssl can be safely ignored.</li>
</ol>
Some modules use third-party libraries.&nbsp; If the library is missing, the AOLserver

 build will continue without error -- it just will not build the offending

 module.&nbsp; The only module in the base server installation that requires an

 external library is "nsssl" (in the nssock/ directory) which requires BSAFE

 from <a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/">http://www.rsasecurity.com/</a>.&nbsp; You can download

 a binary version of nsssl at <a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com/</a>if

 you don't have BSAFE.<br>
<br>
<i>Note: If you have any problems building, the two files <b>include/Makefile.global</b>and

 <b>include/Makefile.module</b>have all the information you need to change

 settings throughout the AOLserver environment.</i><br>
<h2>Installing<br>
</h2>
<p>Type "<tt><b>gmake install</b></tt>" to make a production server.&nbsp; This

 will create an installation directory at /usr/local/aolserver/, populate

 the directories with various&nbsp; startup files and&nbsp; configuration files, copy

 the binaries to the /usr/local/aolsever/bin directory, and finish.&nbsp; To install

 confidence tests, type "make install-tests" and they will appear in the

 tests/ directory of your server's pageroot.&nbsp; The default location for installations

 can be overridden by typing "<tt><b>gmake install PREFIX=/your/directory/</b></tt>".</p>
<p><i>Note:&nbsp; AOLserver requires the modified versions of Tcl included&nbsp; with

 the
distribution.&nbsp; The 7.6 library&nbsp; is heavily modified, mostly for&nbsp; thread
safety

 and ns_share support.&nbsp; The&nbsp; 8.x library is modified slightly&nbsp; to
enable

 thread support through AOLserver's&nbsp; nsthread library and to
patch a few

 minor problems.</i><br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Configuring</h2>
<p>The installation directory contains a file named "sample-config.tcl" which

 represents a complete configuration of AOLserver.&nbsp; This configuration will:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Listen for http connections on your
computer's&nbsp; primary interface at

 port 8000.&nbsp; To use another port&nbsp; and/or
select interfaces,&nbsp; you can set

 the "host" and "httpport" variables.</li>
  <li>Check security settings for nscp (Control Port module) and listen on

 localhost:9999 if they are set.</li>
  <li>Check for the existence of ssl keys (nsssl module) and listen with

 https on port 8443 if they exist.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><i>Note: Some modules have&nbsp; been disabled in the sample nsd.tcl&nbsp; for security
reasons.&nbsp;

 They are <b>nscp </b>and <b>nsperm</b>.&nbsp; They aren't required&nbsp; to run a
server

 unless you want to use&nbsp; the Control Port and/or the Permissions
module,&nbsp;

 respectively.&nbsp; Before using&nbsp; them, change the passwords and
default permissions&nbsp;

 by following the instructions&nbsp; in the AOLserver
documentation.</i></p>
<p>Although&nbsp; you must be root to start AOLserver,&nbsp; the server itself must
change

 to a&nbsp; regular user shortly after initialization. &nbsp; You either
need to start

 the&nbsp; server as a non-root user (in which case you&nbsp; will
not be able to listen&nbsp;

 for connections on privileged ports such as port
80)&nbsp; or you must include&nbsp;

 a -u user command line flag to which the
server will&nbsp; setuid(2) after startup.

 &nbsp; You may either specify a Unix
username or numeric uid, e.g.: &nbsp; <tt>./bin/nsd76

 -t ./config.tcl -u user -g group</tt></p>
<p>AOLserver can be started by executing&nbsp; the <b>nsd76 </b>or <b>nsd8x </b>binary.&nbsp;

 The
choice of nsd76&nbsp; or nsd8x depends on whether you&nbsp; need compatibility
with

 Tcl7.6 (closer&nbsp; to the 7.4 of previous releases)&nbsp; or special
features of

 Tcl8.x (e.g., internationalizaton). &nbsp; For the mode&nbsp; of
operation, there

 are three choices: <b>Foreground, Background, </b>and <b>Inittab.</b></p>
<h3></h3>
In <b>Foreground </b>mode , the server starts&nbsp; and emits diagnostic log messages&nbsp;

 directly to the&nbsp; terminal window. &nbsp; This is useful for testing, configuration

 or debugging&nbsp; a server.&nbsp; To start the server in foreground mode use:<br>
<tt>/bin/nsd&nbsp; -ft ./config.tcl -u user -g group</tt><br>
To stop a server running the foreground simply press&nbsp; interrupt on your keyboard

 (e.g., ctrl-c or the DEL key) which will send a SIGINT to the server and

 initiate shutdown.<br>
<br>
In <b>Background </b>mode, the server&nbsp; forks and disassociates from the terminal.&nbsp;

 Diagnostic messages&nbsp; are&nbsp; appended to log/server.log.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is a&nbsp; typical

 daemon-style mode of operation.&nbsp; To start the server in&nbsp; background&nbsp; mode

 use: &nbsp; <tt>./bin/nsd -t ./config.tcl -u user -g group</tt>.&nbsp; To stop a server

 running&nbsp; the background&nbsp; you may either use the kill(2) command to send

 a SIGTERM to the background&nbsp; process id(*) or the special -K flag of the

 nsd binary.&nbsp; This flag&nbsp; will determine the process id from a special marker&nbsp;

 file, send the signal and wait for shutdown, e.g.:<br>
<tt>./bin/nsd8x -Kt ./config.tcl -u user -g group</tt><br>
You may also use the -k flag to kill and restart a&nbsp; background server.<br>
<br>
In <b>Inittab </b>mode, the server runs in the foreground&nbsp; but opens the&nbsp;

 log file as with background mode.&nbsp; This mode is used&nbsp; when the server is

 started from an entry in the /etc/inittab file. &nbsp; The benefit of this mode

 is that init will restart the server if it&nbsp; happens to crash. &nbsp; Production

 servers at AOL normally run in this mode. &nbsp; To run the server&nbsp; from /etc/inittab,

 add an entry similar to the following, substituting the proper id, run levels,

 and full pathnames:<br>
<tt>w1:23:respawn:/usr/local/as3/bin/nsd&nbsp; -it /usr/local/as3/nsd.tcl -u user

 -g group</tt><br>
To restart a server you can simply kill the current server with the -K flag

 as with the background&nbsp; mode; init will then restart the server for you.&nbsp;

 To stop a&nbsp; server running in inittab mode&nbsp; you must comment out or remove

 the&nbsp; entry from the /etc/inittab file&nbsp; and signal the init process to re-read&nbsp;

 inittab with the "<tt>init q</tt>" command.<br>
<br>
<i>Note:&nbsp; While running AOLserver on some Unix platforms (e.g., Linux,&nbsp; SGI),

 you'll notice multiple nsd&nbsp; processes.&nbsp; This is
normal and represents the

 individual threads.&nbsp; The main&nbsp; process id can
be determined&nbsp; by checking

 the log/nspid.server1 file or looking&nbsp; at the
last few entries&nbsp; of the server

 log, each of which will include the
process&nbsp; id and thread&nbsp; id in the form

 [pid.tid].&nbsp; You can also telnet to the control port and type "ns_info pid".</i><br>

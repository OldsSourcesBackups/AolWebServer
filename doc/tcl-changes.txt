Tcl8.3.2 for AOLserver
----------------------

$Header$


This directory contains a subset of the Tcl8.3.2 files required to build
the nsd8x AOLserver.  The following directories where removed:

	mac tests tools library doc unix/dltest


Otherwise, the files are unchanged except for the following:


Makefile:

	New file in this directory which will execute unix/configure
	with the correct flags and then make libtcl8.3.a with
	a CFLAGS used to build AOLserver.

generic/tclIO.c:

	Changed channel translation mode to binary by default.


generic/tclObj.c:
generic/tclInt.h:

	Changed the Tcl_Obj allocate and free to called ckalloc/ckfree
	directly instead of maintaining the object "cache".  The idea
	is that the AOLserver's -z allocator, utilized by ckalloc/ckfree,
	is faster than the object cache with required mutex lock.


unix/Makefile.in:

	Removed tclUnixThrd.o and tclAlloc.o objects.  The required
	functions are included in thread/tcl8x.c for compatibility
	with nsthreads.

unix/tcl.m4:
unix/configure:

	Commented out the checks for enabling threads and detecting
	the required libraries.  The library dependencies are taken
	care of in the standard AOLserver build environment.  Autoconf
	was used to re-create the configure script with the modified
	tcl.m4.

unix/tclUnixPort.h:

	Modified the definition of TclpMutex to be a void * instead
	of a pthead_mutex for compatibility with Ns_Mutex.


For comparison, copies of the orginal files before modifications
are save as ".orig".

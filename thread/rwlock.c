/* 
 * rwlock.c --
 *
 *	Routines for read/write locks.  Read/write locks differ from a mutex
 *	in that multiple threads can aquire the read lock until a single
 *	thread aquires a write lock.  This code is adapted from that in 
 *	Steven's Unix Network Programming, Volume 3. 
 *
 *	Note:  Read/write locks are almost always a bad idea.  The reason
 *	is that, like critical sections, the number of actual lock operations
 *	is doubled for read/write locks and there are very few cases in
 *	practice where the extra overhead is justified.  For example, if you
 *	think it's a good idea to have a read/write lock around some large
 *	in-memory data structure you're probably wrong:  The overhead of
 *	the read/write lock operations will likely drawf the time spent
 *	grunging around in the data structure.  On a multi-processor machine
 *	this can actually cause a severe performance degradation, locking
 *	up the process under load. As a rule, if you think you need a
 *	read/write lock you probably need to rethink your problem.

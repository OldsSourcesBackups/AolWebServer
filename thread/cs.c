/* 
 * cs.c --
 *
 *	Support for nsthread critical sections.  Critical sections differ
 *	from mutex objects in that a critical section can be repeatedly
 *	locked by the same thread as long as each lock is matched with
 * 	a cooresponding unlock.  Critical sections are used cases where
 *	the lock could be called recursively.
 *
 *	Note:  Critical sections are almost always a bad idea.  You'll
 *	see below that the number of actual lock and unlock operations are
 *	doubled and threads can end up in condition waits instead of spin
 *	locks.  As a rule, if you think you need a critical section you
 * 	probably haven't solved your problem correctly.

<h3><a name="Theory_of_Operation"></a>Theory of Operation</h3>
The nscgi module provides the traditional Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
 that web servers use to run external applications.&nbsp; The nscgi module works
 well for small- to&nbsp; medium-sized applications.&nbsp; For large applications,
 it should not be used due to the severe load that running external applications
 will place on a system.&nbsp; More modern approaches use ADP, Tcl, and C libraries
 instead.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Known_Issues"></a>Known Issues</h3>
The Common Gateway Interface is inefficient, wasteful, and slow -- and nscgi
 is no exception.&nbsp; AOLserver provides a better solution in the form of a
 robust, in-process scripting language with rich Tcl and C API's.&nbsp; The nscgi
 module should only be used for legacy applications for which no redesign
 is possible.<br>
